# Electric-Scooter
Working on taking a regular scooter and converting it into an electric scooter by integrating a brushless hub motor, BMS, ESC, throttle, and brake system.

##  Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|6S Lipo Battery| Provides power to the entire system|
| Brushless Hub Motor | Main motor for propulsion |
| Battery Pack (24V) | Power source for the system |
| BMS | Battery monitoring and protection |
| ESC | Controls motor speed and direction |
| Throttle | Rider speed control |
| Brake Sensors | Ensures safe braking integration |

##Current Status

-Testing physical system [Currently waiting on parts to be delivered]
-Creating the chassis to hold components

## Future Goals

Add an OLED display system that shows the current speed, the battery percentage (and time required for battery to finish charging)
