# Electric Scooter
Working on converting a regular scooter into an electric scooter by integrating a brushless hub motor, BMS, ESC, throttle, and brake system.

## Components

| Component          | Description                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 6S LiPo Battery    | Provides power to the entire system    |
| Brushless Hub Motor| Main motor for propulsion              |
| Battery Pack (24V) | Power source for the system             |
| BMS                | Battery monitoring and protection       |
| ESC                | Controls motor speed and direction     |
| Throttle           | Rider speed control                     |
| Brake Sensors      | Ensures safe braking integration        |

## Current Status

- Testing physical system *(Currently waiting on parts to be delivered)*
- Creating the chassis to hold components

## Future Goals

- Add an OLED display system that shows:
  - Current speed
  - Battery percentage
  - Estimated time to full charge
